# Stock_Prediction_Data_Analytics_Hackathon
This was done as a part of the coursework Data Analytics in PES University in November 2023 

First, we predicted the close prices of the stock in question using ARIMA, SARIMA, ARIMAX and SARIMAX. Further, we suggested the best strategy - Buy, Hold or Sell the stock using machine learning methods like Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and K - Nearest Neighbours .
